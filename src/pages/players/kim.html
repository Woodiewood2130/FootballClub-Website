                    <h2>About The Player</h2>
                    <p>Minjae Kim is a South Korean professional footballer who plays as a center-back for the national team
                        and Ulsan Hyundai in the K League 1. Born on November 15, 1996, in Seoul, Kim began his professional
                        career at the age of 18 with Gyeongnam FC before moving to Jeonbuk Hyundai Motors in 2018. He was
                        instrumental in helping his team win the K League 1 title that year. Kim is known for his
                        physicality, aerial ability, and strong defensive skills, making him a valuable asset for both club
                        and country. He has also represented South Korea at various international tournaments, including the
                        2018 Asian Games and the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. At the age of 26, he is already considered one of the
                        best defenders in South Korean football and has a promising career ahead of him.
