                    <h2>About The Manager </h2>
                    <p>Luciano Spalletti is an Italian football coach and manager who has been involved in the sport for
                        several decades. He was born on March 7, 1959, in Certaldo, Italy. Spalletti began his managerial
                        career in the early 1990s, working his way up the ranks at various Italian clubs before being
                        appointed as head coach of Udinese in 2002. He later went on to manage teams such as Roma, Zenit
                        Saint Petersburg, and Inter Milan, where he enjoyed considerable success and won several domestic
                        and international trophies. Known for his tactical acumen, attention to detail, and ability to
                        develop young talent, Spalletti is widely regarded as one of the top managers in European football.
                        He has also been praised for his passion, leadership, and dedication to the sport. As of 2021, he is
                        without a club but is often linked with potential managerial positions.
