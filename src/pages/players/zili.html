                        Serie A club Napoli and the Poland national team. Born on May 20, 1994, in Poland, Zieliński began
                        his professional career at the age of 17 with the Polish club Zagłębie Lubin. He later moved to
                        Italy, where he played for clubs such as Udinese and Empoli before joining Napoli in 2016. Zieliński
                        quickly became a key player for Napoli, known for his technical ability, vision, and long-range
                        shooting. He is also versatile, capable of playing in multiple positions in midfield. Zieliński has
                        represented the Poland national team since 2013, playing in major tournaments such as the UEFA
                        European Championship and the FIFA World Cup. At 28 years old, Zieliński is considered one of the
                        best midfielders in Serie A and is highly valued by both club and country.
