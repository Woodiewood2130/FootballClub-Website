                    <h2>About The Player</h2>
                    <p>Mário Rui is an Italian professional footballer who plays as a left-back for the Italian Serie A club
                        Napoli and the Portugal national team. Born on May 27, 1991, in Portugal, Rui began his professional
                        career at the age of 17 with the Portuguese club Benfica. He later played for other Portuguese clubs
                        such as CD Fatima, Feirense, and Braga, before moving to Italy in 2016 to join Empoli. Rui's
                        performances at Empoli caught the eye of Napoli, and he signed for the Naples-based club in 2017. He
                        has since become an integral part of Napoli's defense, known for his solid defensive skills and
                        attacking prowess down the left flank. Rui has also represented the Portugal national team since
                        2018, playing a key role in their qualification for the 2022 World Cup. At 31 years old, Rui is an
                        experienced player who continues to impress both club and country with his performances.
