                        <h2>About The Player</h2>
                        <p>Matteo Politano is an Italian professional footballer who plays as a forward or winger for the Italian club Napoli and the Italy national team. Born on August 3, 1993, in Rome, Italy, Politano started his professional football career with the Italian club Roma, but he spent most of his early career on loan to several other clubs. In 2016, he signed with Sassuolo, where he played for two seasons before moving to Inter Milan. After a successful stint at Inter, he joined Napoli on loan in 2020, before making the move permanent the following year. Known for his pace, dribbling, and excellent technical ability, Politano is a versatile attacker who can play on either flank or in a central position. He has represented Italy at the under-21 and senior levels and was part of the squad that won the UEFA European Under-21 Championship in 2019. At 28 years old, Politano is considered one of the most promising attacking talents in Italian football and is a key player for Napoli.</p>
