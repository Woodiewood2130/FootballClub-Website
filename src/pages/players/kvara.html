                    <h2>About The Player</h2>
                    <p>Khvicha Kvaratskhelia is a Georgian professional footballer who currently plays as a left winger and
                        forward for the Russian club Rubin Kazan and the Georgian national team. He was born on October 8,
                        1996, in the Georgian capital of Tbilisi. Kvaratskhelia began his professional career with the
                        Georgian club Saburtalo Tbilisi before moving to Rubin Kazan in 2020. He quickly established himself
                        as one of the team's key players, impressing fans and pundits with his technical ability, dribbling
                        skills, and eye for goal. Kvaratskhelia has represented Georgia at the under-17, under-19, and
                        senior levels and has become one of the team's most important players in recent years. At only 24
                        years old, he is considered one of the brightest young talents in Georgian football and has a
                        promising future ahead of him.
